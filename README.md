# RouletteRiskAssessment
RouletteRiskAssessment.py, is a simple risk assessment tool for a game of roulette.

 It allows the user to input a number they want to bet on and the number of spins they want to simulate. The script then simulates the game of roulette for the given number of spins and calculates the risk associated with betting on the specified number.

The risk is calculated as 1 - expected_return, where expected_return is the expected return on investment from placing the bet. The script then prints the calculated risk and provides an explanation of what the risk number means.

Please note that this script is for illustrative purposes only and does not guarantee any outcomes
